# Task 7
Write a function maj in Racket that takes three lists x, y and z of equal length and containing only 0’s and 1’s. It should return a list containing a 1 where two or more of x, y and z contain 1’s, and 0 otherwise. For example: 
```Racket
> (maj (list 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1) (list 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1) (list 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1)) 
'(0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1)
```

## Majority
