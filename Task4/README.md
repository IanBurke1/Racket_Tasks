# Task 4
Write a function sublsum in Racket that takes a list (of integers) as input and returns a list of sublists of it that sum to zero. For this problem, you can use the combinations built-in function. Note the order of the sublists and their elements doesnâ€™t matter. For example:
```Racket
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 -5)) 
'((2 3 -5) (-5 1 4))
```
```Racket
> (sublsum (list 1 2 3 4 5)) 
'()
```

## Step 1
Create a function called sublsum that takes in a list and return every combination of the list.
```Racket
(define (sublsum? l)
  (combinations l))

(sublsum? (list 1 2 3 4 -5))
```
output
```Racket
'(()
  (1)
  (2)
  (1 2)
  (3)
  (1 3)
  (2 3)
  (1 2 3)
  (4)
  (1 4)
  (2 4)
  (1 2 4)
  (3 4)
  (1 3 4)
  (2 3 4)
  (1 2 3 4)
  (-5)
  (1 -5)
  (2 -5)
  (1 2 -5)
  (3 -5)
  (1 3 -5)
  (2 3 -5)
  (1 2 3 -5)
  (4 -5)
  (1 4 -5)
  (2 4 -5)
  (1 2 4 -5)
  (3 4 -5)
  (1 3 4 -5)
  (2 3 4 -5)
  (1 2 3 4 -5))
```
In my head I know that we would have to check that the sum of each combination equals to zero, if it does then print it out otherwise return null. Trying to translate that into racket is the hard part!
