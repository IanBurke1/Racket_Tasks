# Racket Tasks
#### *Theory of Algorithms - Lecturer: [Dr Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development*
This repository contains solutions to a number of tasks for [Theory of Algorithms](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/theoryofalgorithms) 4th year module. The solutions will be written in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Language.

## Task 1
1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise. Call the function decide-prime.

## Racket
Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

DrRacket is a graphical environment for developing programs using the Racket programming languages.
