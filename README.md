# Racket Tasks
#### *Theory of Algorithms - Lecturer: [Dr Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development*
This repository contains solutions to a number of tasks for [Theory of Algorithms](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/theoryofalgorithms) 4th year module. The solutions will be written in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Language.

## Task 1
1. Write, from scratch, a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and return true if the number is a prime and false otherwise. Call the function decide-prime.
