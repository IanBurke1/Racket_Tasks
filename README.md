# Functional Programming
#### *Theory of Algorithms - Lecturer: [Dr Ian McLoughlin](ianmcloughlin.github.io) - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development*
This repository contains solutions to a number of tasks (Continuous assessments) for [Theory of Algorithms](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/theoryofalgorithms) 4th year module. The solutions will be written in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) Language.

**_The tasks sheet can be found at: [RacketTasks.pdf](https://github.com/ianburkeixiv/Racket_Tasks/blob/master/RacketTasks.pdf)_**



## How to run
1. Download and install [Racket](http://download.racket-lang.org/).
2. Open DrRacket to run the above Racket tasks. For example:

## Racket
Racket is a general purpose, multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp-Scheme family. One of its design goals is to serve as a platform for language creation, design, and implementation. The language is used in a variety of contexts such as scripting, general-purpose programming, computer science education, and research.

## DrRacket
DrRacket (formerly DrScheme) is widely used among introductory Computer Science courses that teach Scheme or Racket and is lauded for its simplicity and appeal to beginner programmers. The IDE was originally built for use with the TeachScheme! project (now ProgramByDesign), an outreach effort by Northeastern University and a number of affiliated universities for attracting high school students to computer science courses at the college level.
The editor provides source highlighting for syntax and run-time errors, parenthesis matching, a debugger and an algebraic stepper. Its student-friendly features include support for multiple "language levels" (Beginning Student, Intermediate Student and so on). It also has integrated library support, and sophisticated analysis tools for advanced programmers. In addition, module-oriented programming is supported with the module browser, a contour view, integrated testing and coverage measurements, and refactoring support. It provides integrated, context-sensitive access to an extensive hyper-linked help system named "Help Desk".
