; hamming-distance function used to calculate the hamming distance between 2 lists
(define (hamming-distance l li)
  ; if the length of l is equal to length of li then..
  (if (= (length l)(length li))
      (hamming-distance (cdr l) (cdr li))
      (+ 1 (hamming-distance (cdr l) (cdr li)))))

; Passing in our 2 lists
(hamming-distance (list 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0)(list 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0)) ; Expected result: 5
